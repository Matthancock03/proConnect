====================================================
School project. Imitation of LinkedIn webapp. 

To run this web app clone the repo to your local directory. After the project has downloaded navigate to the 
folder in your command line. 

Issue the command ./activator ~run.

This will start a local netty server and load the project onto the server. You will then be able launch the app in your browser by pointing it to localhost:9000.

Any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the server immediately. You will simply refresh the page and see the changes.
